# Random quote generator web app - using an API

The challenge was to build a quote app that uses a quotes API to display famous quotes by different authors.


## Random quote generator

The Random quote generator is a web app that displays 1643 quotes by different authors. It uses the fetch API (https://type.fit/api/quotes).

### The project
+ was built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and the fetch API (https://type.fit/api/quotes)
+ has a very long comment in the JS file (a lot of different variations of the code which somehow didn't work for me)
+ used the fetch API (https://type.fit/api/quotes)
+ is my first API project (which works)
+ has a good design
+ **_works_** ðŸ™‚

### Conclusion
It was a really useful project. I tried out a lot of variations of using an API and installed Node.JS. I am really proud of this project because it works, although I had difficulties installing Node.JS (the installation took 7 hours), to make a better JavaScript environment and to find out how to use an API in this project. I am looking forward to participating in the next Global Hack Week ðŸ™‚
